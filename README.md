# -Analyzing-Gender-Imbalances-in-Movies
Inequalities based on identity can be seen within nearly every facet of society, and gender and
race are arguably the two greatest defining characteristics of identity. Historical oppression and
the marginalization of individuals considered minorities have led to the imbalances of such
identities in practically every societal sphere. From politics and academia to job opportunities
and income disparities, imbalances have existed throughout time. We aim to examine imbalances
of gender identity within the context of art and creative spaces. Within this realm, we can dive
deeper into films and productions, as there have been great historical gender imbalances, with the
rolies of producers, directors, actors, and crew often largely male and not having diverse gender
identities. One 2017 study examining gender imbalances within director roles found that within
the top 1,100 movies, only 4.3% of directors were female (“Hollywood’s Hiring Freeze”, 2018).
This extreme statistic is representative of imbalances within one role within film productions, but
we want to learn more about the same issue regarding the roles of actors. To understand more
about this phenomenon, we will explore occurrences of gender imbalance of actors within the
Hollywood film industry and will do so by examining data regarding Hollywood movies
